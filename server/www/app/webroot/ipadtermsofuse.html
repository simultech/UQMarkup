<h1>Participant Information for Academic Staff</h1>

<h2>Project Title</h2>
<p>UQMarkUp: Effective feedback and consistent assessment for large cohorts with e-learning enabled 'in situ' commenting</p>

<h2>Chief Investigators</h2>
<p>Dr Kirsten Zimbardi, Dr Kay Colthorpe, Prof Phil Long, Dr Craig Engstrom, Dr Andrea Bugarcic</p>

<h2>What this project is about</h2>
<p>The Centre for Educational Innovation and Technology (CEIT) in partnership with Human Movement Studies (HMS) developed and trialled an e-learning system (UQMarkUp) which allows markers to provide students with detailed, specifically targeted and personalised feedback in a timely and efficient fashion.  It allows markers to insert audio, handwritten and typed comments anywhere within the student’s work.  </p>
<p>This project extends the use of UQMarkUp to several large School of Biomedical Science Courses, across a range of assessment tasks.  In addition, a new feature has been developed to moderate tutor marking of student work.</p>
<p>The aims of this study is to advance, implement and evaluate an innovative audio-visual technology to optimise the quality, accessibility and efficacy of assessment feedback in a range of tertiary education settings.</p>

<h2>The data we are collecting</h2>
<p>To do this we need your help as a coordinator or tutor in the School of Biomedical Science at the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>We will be collecting:<ul>
<li>Your usage of the features and functions of UQMarkUp</li>
<li>Your engagement with the feedback provided via UQMarkUp and traditional or existing methods of providing this feedback</li>
<li>Your views on the method, mode and format of feedback provided to or by you</li>
<p>If you do agree to participate, information about you will also be collected by survey and/or interview.  This will include information regarding:</p>
<ul><li>Your experience as a coordinator or tutor in the course</li>
<li>Whether you are also currently a student and the type of program you are currently undertaking.</li></ul>
<p>Importantly, participation in this study simply requires you to provide permission for your data from university records to be accessed by the researchers.</p>
<p>You may also be asked to complete surveys and participate in interviews to obtain your views about the feedback provided to you.</p>

<h2>How we use this data & confidentiality</h2>
<p>All information collected from you will be de-identified and/or allocated a code to enable the alignment of all data collected.</p>
<p>All information that is obtained will be strictly confidential and will only be accessed by the researchers.  Taking part in this study is voluntary and you are free to withdraw from participating at any time.  Feedback regarding the major findings of the research will be emailed to you on completion of the project.</p>

<h2>We will provide you with information once the study has concluded</h2>
<p>At the conclusion of the study, the major findings of the research will be compiled in “everyday” language and emailed to you.</p>

<h2>Risk to you & Benefits to you</h2>
<p>
There are no risks to you participating in this study beyond those that exist in normal daily life.</p>
<p>You will not receive any benefits from participating in this study other than low value gifts for participating in
interviews and possible professional development in –
<ol>
<li>Technology: Use of an iPad and the use of am iPad/web based application for giving feedback; and</li>
<li>Professional: Possible improved skills in giving feedback to students.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>You may elect to withdraw at any time</h2>
<p>The decision to participate in this study is entirely voluntary and you are free to withdraw your participation in this study at any time, without prejudice or repercussion.  To do this, simply email the Project Leader – Dr Kirsten Zimbardi (k.zimbardi@uq.edu.au) stating your name, course details, and request to withdraw. The materials containing the data you have provided
will be identified and deleted from our records.</p>
 
<h2>Ethics clearance</h2>
<p>This study has been cleared by one of the human ethics committees of the University of Queensland in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council’s guidelines.  You are welcome to discuss your participation in this study with project staff (phone 3365 2931).  If you would like to speak to an officer of the University not involved in this study, you may contact the Ethics Officer on 3365 3924.</p>
